# Assortment Of Projects Not Done

A collection of various projects in development, each maintained in its own isolated directory.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project is stored in its own directory to prevent code intermingling:

```
AssortmentOfProjectsNotDone/
├── README.md                 # This file
├── .gitignore               # Global ignore patterns
├── project-1/               # Individual project folder
│   ├── README.md           # Project-specific documentation
│   ├── src/                # Source code
│   └── ...                 # Other project files
├── project-2/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src/
│   └── ...

```

## 📋 Guidelines

### Adding a New Project

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name (use kebab-case)
2. Add a README.md in the project directory
3. Keep all project files within its directory
4. Update this main README with project info

### Project Directory Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `my-awesome-project`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include tech stack if relevant: `react-todo-app`

### Project README Template

Each project should have its own README with:
- Project name and description
- Installation instructions
- Usage/Running instructions
- Dependencies
- TODO/Progress tracking
- Any relevant notes

## 🔧 Common .gitignore Patterns

The root `.gitignore` contains patterns common to all projects. Individual projects can have their own `.gitignore` for project-specific patterns.

## 📝 Notes

- This repository serves as a storage medium for work-in-progress projects
- Each project is completely isolated from others
- Projects can be moved to their own repositories when ready
